# Wizard Draw
Wizard Draw is an endless game in which the players prevent the descending boards from touching the bottom line. 
## Guideline
Each wooden board has a shape on it, which when drawn will make the board disappear. When a shape is drawn on the white window on the right of the screen, all boards that have the shape will disappear.
## Background Music
Players can choose to mute or play the background music.
## Levels
Players reach a higher level after every 50 points. At higher levels, the speed and number of the boards are increased.
